== Preface ==

This document defines a standard for asynchronous messaging for any company's Event Architecture. 
It is a programming language-agnostic interface description for asynchronous message processing. 
It is also intended to be message platform-agnostic. 
All messages published by any producer must conform to these standards. 
The specification also provides consumer of the messages with the detailed information they need to properly understand, consume and process these messages.
